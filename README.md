Greetings, it was something that I have developed and planned for a long time, I did finally you know that I shared my blacklist weapon add-on 1-2 days ago and this is its continuation. Everything you see in the video below is blocked. Now let me answer what you want to ask:


Why Free? : Because you know that there are a lot of tricks in fivem and I had such a project for my contribution, I think I completed it successfully.


Why Server.lua is encrypted: Because I host server.luada discord logs and I don't want people to change their discord logs to xx-anticheat. Personally, I think you wouldn't want such a thing. there is not a single line of code.



How is it used? I will tell you the usage below



What are the Properties of Anticheat:



- BlackListExplosions

- BlacklistedWeapons

- AntiWords

- BlacklistProps

- BlacklistVehicles

- BlacklistPeds

- BlacklistEvent (It will come soon, I'm working on it)





Is it really resistant to all cheats: Of course no, I didn't get all cheat menus, unfortunately, I don't know the methods very well, but I think it will prevent what I wrote above.





Note: As I said, my goal is to relieve your servers a little bit, I don't have any earnings, I'm sharing it for free. I hope you like it, I am waiting for your comments.
